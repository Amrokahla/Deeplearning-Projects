# DeepLearning Projects

This repository contains various **DeepLearning Learning** and **Modeling** projects. Each project demonstrates a unique aspect of predictive modeling, data preprocessing, model aechitictures, and algorithm implementation.

## Projects

#### 1. [Neural Networks Implelementation](./Neural_Networks_Implelementation)
   - **Description**: Building Neural Networks from scratch. Going through steps of forward and backward probagations in detalis and implelemnting them, then test on toy datset.

#### 2. [Credit Score Prediction with NN](./Credit_Score_Prediction_with_NN)
   - **Description**: Working on the complex Credit Score Dataset with deeplearining techniques to get good results using Neural Network aechiticture

#### 3. [CIFAR10 with different CNN archtictures](./CIFAR10_with_different_CNN_archtictures)
   - **Description**: Classifying CIFAR10 dataset using different CNN archtictures. Use transfer learning and fine-tuning as alternative to build CNN.

#### 4. [Lung CT-Scans Segemnation](./Lung_CT-Scans_Segemnation)
   - **Description**: Segmenting Lung CT-scan using a U-Net model built from scratch to accurately delineate lung regions in medical images.
