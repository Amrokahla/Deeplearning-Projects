# DeepLearning Projects

This repository contains various **DeepLearning Learning** and **Modeling** projects. Each project demonstrates a unique aspect of predictive modeling, data preprocessing, model aechitictures, and algorithm implementation.

## Projects

#### 1. [Neural Networks Implelementation](./Neural_Networks_Implelementation)
   - **Description**: Built neural networks from scratch, covering detailed steps of forward and backward propagation. Implemented these algorithms and tested them on toy datasets to validate performance.

#### 2. [Credit Score Prediction with NN](./Credit_Score_Prediction_with_NN)
   - **Description**: Developed deep learning models to predict credit scores based on a complex dataset. Focused on designing effective neural network architectures to achieve high predictive accuracy.

#### 3. [CIFAR10 with different CNN archtictures](./CIFAR10_with_different_CNN_archtictures)
   - **Description**: Applied various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures to classify the CIFAR-10 dataset. Explored both custom CNN models and transfer learning techniques with fine-tuning.

#### 4. [Lung CT-Scans Segemnation](./Lung_CT-Scans_Segemnation)
   - **Description**: Implemented a U-Net architecture from scratch to segment lung regions in CT-scan images, aiming for accurate and efficient medical image analysis.

#### 5. [MNIST with RNNs](./MNIST_with_RNNs)
   - **Description**: Used recurrent models (RNN, LSTM, GRU) to classify the MNIST dataset. Experimented with different architectures and training strategies to optimize sequential model performance.
